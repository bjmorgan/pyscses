`pyscses` is a Python package for modelling ionic space-charges in solid electrolytes. Its primary use is to calculate equilibrium distributions of point-charge atomic defects within one-dimensional &ldquo;Poisson-Boltzmann&rdquo;-like mean-field models. These calculations take as inputs a set of defect site positions, within a specific crystal structure, and the associated defect segregation energies. `pyscses` can also be used to calculate ionic transport properties (space-charge resistivities and activation energies) for these equilibrium defect distributions.

One approach to modelling space-charge formation in solid electrolytes is to consider defects as ideal point-charges embedded in a continuum dielectric, and to calculate equilibrium defect distributions by solving mean-field &ldquo;Poisson-Boltzmann&rdquo;-like equations. While numerical solutions to the 1D Poisson-Boltzmann equation are relatively simple to implement, published results are typically obtained using private closed-source codes, making it difficult to reproduce results or to test the effect of different approximations included in specific models. ``pyscses`` provides an open-source Python package for modelling space-charge formation in solid electrolytes, within a 1D Poisson-Boltzmann-like formalism.We are currently using ``pyscses`` in our own research into space-charge formation in solid electrolytes for fuel cells and lithium-ion batteries, and hope that this open-source resource will support reproducible research practices in future studies in this area \[[1](#SandveEtAl_PLoSComputBiol2013)\].

``pyscses`` implements a range of numerical models within the general scheme of solving a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation on a 1D grid:
- Continuum (regular grid) and site-explicit (irregular grid) models.
- Periodic and Dirichlet boundary conditions.
- &ldquo;Mott-Schottky&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gouy-Champman&rdquo; condtions. These are implemented by setting the mobilities of different defect species. In the case of Mott-Schottky conditions, all but one defect species have a mobility of zero.
- Inclusion of &ldquo;lattice&rdquo;site charges to account for non-defective species in the crystal structure.

Properties that can be calculated include:
- Defect mole fractions.
- Charge density.
- Electrostatic potential.
- Parallel and perpendicular grain boundary resistivities \[[2](#HwangEtAl_JElectroceram1999)\].
- Grain boundary activation energies \[[3](#Kim_PhysChemChemPhys2016)\].

Full mathematical derivations, definitions and example code can be found in the [userguide](https://github.com/bjmorgan/pyscses/blob/master/userguides/notebooks/userguide.ipynb). 

A more detailed overview of the code and its capabilities, and of the scientific context of modelling space-charge regions in solids, are given in the [JOSS paper](http://joss.theoj.org/papers/803ed6dd19f453819bdd3ed9ceadf3b3).

## Documentation
### Userguides
Introductory userguides are contained in the [userguide](https://github.com/bjmorgan/pyscses/blob/master/userguides/README.md). Each guide is presented as a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#). The userguides cover the theory behind the Poisson-Boltzmann solver, how to set up a Jupyter notebook to run a calculation and examples of running the calculation under different approximations. These examples include site-explicit versus continuum models, Mott-Schottky (single mobile defect species) and Gouy-Chapman (all defect species mobile) conditions,  and running the solver on real data.

These userguides can also be found in the directory:
```
pyscses/userguides/userguide.ipynb
```
For online viewing of these userguides, we recommend using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org). The links below open nbviewer versions of each userguide notebook.

### API Documentation
API documentation can be found [here](https://pyscses.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Installation
Source code is available as a git repository at [https://github.com/bjmorgan/pyscses/tree/master/pyscses](https://github.com/bjmorgan/pyscses/tree/master/pyscses)
  
The simplest way to install `pyscses` is to use `pip` to install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyscses/)
```
pip install pyscses
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/bjmorgan/pyscses/releases), and install directly:
```
cd pyscses
pip install -e .
```
which installs an editable (-e) version of pyscses in your userspace.

Or clone the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/bjmorgan/pyscses/releases) with
```
git clone git@github.com:bjmorgan/pyscses.git
```
and install the same way.
```
cd pyscses
pip install -e .
```
## Tests

The directory `tests/test_notebooks` contains a set of Jupyter notebooks with specified outputs, that can be run to test code functionality. The test notebooks can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/bjmorgan/pyscses/tree/master/tests/test_notebooks).

There are four directories with varying conditions. In each there is a Jupyter notebook which can be run. The input for the calculations is stored in the `input_data` directory and the output for the calculations will be stored in the `generated_data` directory and can be compared to the verified data in the `expected_outputs` directory. A list of the input parameters used in the notebooks is reiterated in each of the four test folders in the `input_parameters` file. 

### Unit tests

Limited unit tests are contained in the top `tests` directory. These can be run using
```
cd tests
python -m unittest discover
```
Automated unit testing of the latest commit happens [here](https://travis-ci.org/bjmorgan/pyscses/).
